# Housing Price Prediction - Regularized Regression Techniques

Objective\n
The goal of this project was to use EDA, visualization, data cleaning, preprocessing, and prediction modelling to predict home prices given the features of the home, and interpret your models to find out what features add value to a home. The data was originally taken from Kaggle, this dataset is a part of the Housing prices : Advanced Regression Techniques Challenge

Background
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
